# Virus Spread Simulation
Simplistic simulation model for the spread of a virus.
Made to support our report for the Singapore Mathematical Society Essay Competition 2021. 


### v1.0: Original scripts I archived
**Unit Script** is the code for each "person". 

**TestSystem** is just a script that adds on to the UnitController script.

**UnitController** Script is code that controls all people and relevant factors in the simulation.

**GameController** Script controls the debugging side of things.

**Test.txt** is the original text file with all the test results that are not used.

**Simul.txt** contains most of the actual results used in the final essay submission.


### v2.0
I remade the simulation in a couple of days to improve clarity, usability and code (as well as to sate my boredom). 
Under this section is complete source code for the v2.0 Unity project.
